// ----- TODO ----- //

- Add skybox
	- Create the required buffers and fill them with data:
		- create six quads in 3D space with texture coordinates
		- create the corresponding index data
	- Create a shader that can process the data and draw the textures on the quads

	
- Exclude vertices behind camera
	The whole way of mapping directions into the clip space should be reviewed.
	When I create a huge sphere, and watch the scene inside, I see weird behaviour.
		Most likely due to the vertices behind the observer.

- Upload all meshes into one buffer with ID's (ID should be part of the vertex layout), and add a uniform arrays that stores the transforms

- Move input handling somewhere else, currently it is in the main functions game loop

- Revise the matrix library and rewrite to column major

- Add aspect ratio into the shader as a uniform float

- Add timesteps
